- You are required to implement the provided skeleton code files.

- Please rename each file by removing the word "skeleton" from the filename.
  For example:
      👉 calculateSum_skeleton.c → calculateSum.c

- Place all renamed files in the same directory as the rest of the framework files to ensure proper testing of your implementation.

- Do not modify any files in the Framework directory, except for the following:
  TESTCASES.txt – to paste the test cases you want to run
  EXPECTED_OUTPUT.txt – to paste the expected output corresponding to the test cases in EXPECTED_OUTPUT.txt
